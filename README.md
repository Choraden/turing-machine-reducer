# TURING MACHINE REDUCER

This assignment was part of the course Computational complexity at MIMUW.
The goal is to reduce two-tape *deterministic* Turing Machine to one-tape *deterministic* Turing Machine. 

### HOW TO RUN
- Compile with `make`
- `./tm_reducer` `<two-tape TM definition>` `<filename for new one-tape TM>`
- Run the reduced machine `./tm_interpreter` `<TM definition>` `<input word>`
